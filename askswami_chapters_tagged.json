How do we uproot them? \nb) If we are what we think, will these negative thoughts bring us suffering/misery? \nIf we become what we think, then how does karma come into play? Some people \nseem to be positive thinkers, even if they are not necessarily good people. However, \ntheir lives seem to be quite good and peaceful. So it it our thoughts, or is it our karma \nthat makes our destiny? \n14:56 -- What exactly is meant by the term \"\"faultlines\"\" with regards to pointing out the \n\"\"errors in Maya?\"\" (referencing a previous lecture in which Swami Sarvapriyanandaji \nhad used this term). \n42:25 -- a) Could the Blissful experience of sleep be due to sleep related hormones \n(serotonin, endorphins etc.) rather than to the Bliss inherent in Consciousness? \n45:47 -- a) In deep sleep, is the Bliss we experience the \"\"Ananda\"\" of \"\"Sat-Chit-\nAnanda?\"\" \n48:23 -- b) Unconsciousness seems to be different from deep sleep, because it seems\nto be completely blank. Additionally, after coming up from that state, one doesn't feel \nrested or peaceful. On the contrary, one often feels uneasy. But ultimately, if it is \nAnanda, it should be there everywhere (in deep sleep as well as unconsciousness) \nshouldn't it? \n50:50 -- c) So is it that the happiness of deep sleep is due to serotonin and/or other \nchemicals that are involved in neurochemical processes? \n55:13 -- One can say that the substratum of human Consciousness is Pure \nAwareness. How can we extend it to include the whole material Universe, and posit \nthat Pure Consciousness is its substratum? \n59:22 -- Should we assume that each one of us has our own consciousness, and if so, \nwhat about events which affect all of us? How do we explain that shared public \nreality? \n1:05:57 -- Is Consciousness separate from the brain? \n1:12:52 -- a) Is it true that householders should not chant only \"\"Om,\"\" but instead use \nsome syllable along with it (such as \"\"Hari Om\"\" etc.)? Will simply chanting \"\"Om\"\" (as a \nhouseholder) have adverse effects? \n1:14:42 -- b) Could \"\"namakam\"\" and \"\"chamakam\"\" (Vedic mantras) be used as \nworship mantras in rituals, upasana, self-Knowledge, God-realization, jnana etc.? \n1:20:50 -- How is Consciousness experienced? How do we know/grasp it? What \nexactly is Consciousness, Atman, Awareness, Pure Consciousness, Brahman etc.? \n1:26:16 -- The Awareness, or Consciousness (Atma, Chaitanya etc.) is common to all\nof us. Rather, we are That.

How do we uproot them? \nb) If we are what we think, will these negative thoughts bring us suffering/misery? \nIf we become what we think, then how does karma come into play? Some people \nseem to be positive thinkers, even if they are not necessarily good people. However, \ntheir lives seem to be quite good and peaceful. So it it our thoughts, or is it our karma \nthat makes our destiny? \n14:56 -- What exactly is meant by the term \"\"faultlines\"\" with regards to pointing out the \n\"\"errors in Maya?\"\" (referencing a previous lecture in which Swami Sarvapriyanandaji \nhad used this term). \n42:25 -- a) Could the Blissful experience of sleep be due to sleep related hormones \n(serotonin, endorphins etc.) rather than to the Bliss inherent in Consciousness? \n45:47 -- a) In deep sleep, is the Bliss we experience the \"\"Ananda\"\" of \"\"Sat-Chit-\nAnanda?\"\" \n48:23 -- b) Unconsciousness seems to be different from deep sleep, because it seems\nto be completely blank. Additionally, after coming up from that state, one doesn't feel \nrested or peaceful. On the contrary, one often feels uneasy. But ultimately, if it is \nAnanda, it should be there everywhere (in deep sleep as well as unconsciousness) \nshouldn't it? \n50:50 -- c) So is it that the happiness of deep sleep is due to serotonin and/or other \nchemicals that are involved in neurochemical processes? \n55:13 -- One can say that the substratum of human Consciousness is Pure \nAwareness. How can we extend it to include the whole material Universe, and posit \nthat Pure Consciousness is its substratum? \n59:22 -- Should we assume that each one of us has our own consciousness, and if so, \nwhat about events which affect all of us? How do we explain that shared public \nreality? \n1:05:57 -- Is Consciousness separate from the brain? \n1:12:52 -- a) Is it true that householders should not chant only \"\"Om,\"\" but instead use \nsome syllable along with it (such as \"\"Hari Om\"\" etc.)? Will simply chanting \"\"Om\"\" (as a \nhouseholder) have adverse effects? \n1:14:42 -- b) Could \"\"namakam\"\" and \"\"chamakam\"\" (Vedic mantras) be used as \nworship mantras in rituals, upasana, self-Knowledge, God-realization, jnana etc.? \n1:20:50 -- How is Consciousness experienced?

    "description": "Q&A session lead by Swami Sarvapriyananda as part of a spiritual retreat at the Vedanta Society of New York on Mar 25th, 2017.\nList of Questions with Timestamps:\n1:00 -- a) Involuntary thoughts are mostly negative and bad. How do we uproot them? \nb) If we are what we think, will these negative thoughts bring us suffering/misery? \nIf we become what we think, then how does karma come into play? Some people \nseem to be positive thinkers, even if they are not necessarily good people. However, \ntheir lives seem to be quite good and peaceful. So it it our thoughts, or is it our karma \nthat makes our destiny? \n14:56 -- What exactly is meant by the term \"\"faultlines\"\" with regards to pointing out the \n\"\"errors in Maya?\"\" (referencing a previous lecture in which Swami Sarvapriyanandaji \nhad used this term). \n42:25 -- a) Could the Blissful experience of sleep be due to sleep related hormones \n(serotonin, endorphins etc.) rather than to the Bliss inherent in Consciousness? \n45:47 -- a) In deep sleep, is the Bliss we experience the \"\"Ananda\"\" of \"\"Sat-Chit-\nAnanda?\"\" \n48:23 -- b) Unconsciousness seems to be different from deep sleep, because it seems\nto be completely blank. Additionally, after coming up from that state, one doesn't feel \nrested or peaceful. On the contrary, one often feels uneasy. But ultimately, if it is \nAnanda, it should be there everywhere (in deep sleep as well as unconsciousness) \nshouldn't it? \n50:50 -- c) So is it that the happiness of deep sleep is due to serotonin and/or other \nchemicals that are involved in neurochemical processes? \n55:13 -- One can say that the substratum of human Consciousness is Pure \nAwareness. How can we extend it to include the whole material Universe, and posit \nthat Pure Consciousness is its substratum? \n59:22 -- Should we assume that each one of us has our own consciousness, and if so, \nwhat about events which affect all of us? How do we explain that shared public \nreality? \n1:05:57 -- Is Consciousness separate from the brain? \n1:12:52 -- a) Is it true that householders should not chant only \"\"Om,\"\" but instead use \nsome syllable along with it (such as \"\"Hari Om\"\" etc.)? Will simply chanting \"\"Om\"\" (as a \nhouseholder) have adverse effects? \n1:14:42 -- b) Could \"\"namakam\"\" and \"\"chamakam\"\" (Vedic mantras) be used as \nworship mantras in rituals, upasana, self-Knowledge, God-realization, jnana etc.? \n1:20:50 -- How is Consciousness experienced? How do we know/grasp it? What \nexactly is Consciousness, Atman, Awareness, Pure Consciousness, Brahman etc.? \n1:26:16 -- The Awareness, or Consciousness (Atma, Chaitanya etc.) is common to all\nof us. Rather, we are That. Then what accounts for the differences between us \n(between Vivekananda and the rest of us, yogis who have extraordinary powers, \npsychic powers, siddhis etc.)?\n\n► Support the Vedanta Society of New York: http://bit.ly/SupportVedantaNY\nWeb: http://vedantany.org\nSoundcloud: http://Soundcloud.com/VedantaNY\niTunes Podcast: http://bit.ly/vedanta-talks-itunes\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/vedanta-talks-google-play\n\nABOUT VEDANTA\nVedanta is one of the world’s most ancient religious philosophies and one of its broadest.

Are we still held accountable for them especially negative thoughts? Can we control them? \n21:07 - Do spiritual practices (meditation, mantra, japa, prayer etc.) give us a window of opportunity to choose our reaction to thoughts instead of reacting automatically/instinctively? \n24:11 - Is spiritual progress/knowledge lost if one doesn't attain liberation in this life? \n32:43 - Is it possible to communicate with departed souls? \n40:47 - What Vedantic texts should a spiritual seeker sequentially study? \n46:55 - How does one know if one is making progress in meditation? Are there any landmarks?\n51:23 - Can/will we lose our way on the spiritual path/spiritual life? Will we get the opportunity to continue from where we left off in the next life?\n56:59 - Is death experience an extended deep sleep experience? Is consciousness situated behind our eyes in the form of \"drishta\"? If our consciousness is not body/eyes, not mind, not memories etc., then the only element left is darkness.
